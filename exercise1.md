# Exercise 11.1

![CI/CD](https://kubesphere.io/images/devops/dev-ops.png)

## Step 1 - Linting, Testing, Building

*I am assuming the team builds a **python application***

## Linting
>Pylint library

For python applications pylint library is used widely for linting, It is a good formating tool also a good bug and quality checker.

>Black

Black is a good tool for code foramtting in python.

## Testing
>Pytest

Pytest is an easy-to-use Python testing tool that doesnâ€™t require boilerplate code or an API. Its features include: detailed info on failing assert statements, auto-discovery of test modules and functions, modular fixtures for managing small or parametrized long-lived test resources, and rich plugin architecture.

## Build
>BitBake

BitBake is a make-like build tool with the special focus of distributions and packages for embedded Linux cross compilation, although it is not limited to that. It is inspired by Portage, which is the package management system used by the Gentoo Linux distribution.

## Step 2 - Alternatives for Jenkins and Github actions

>Buddy

Buddy is a CI/CD tool which removes the chores of configuring and managing Jenkins with a smart UI/UX that makes it very easy to build, test, and deploy quality software faster.

>GitLab

GitLab CI is a part of GitLab. It is a web application with an API that stores its state in a database. It manages projects and provides a friendly user interface, besides offering the advantage of all the features of GitLab.

## Step 3 - Self-hosted / Cloud-based environments

### Self-hosted
- For large scale applications.
- Everything is under control.
- Maintainence is high.
- Cost to get items and setting up is high.

### Cloud-based
- For small/medium scale application.
- Easy maintainence.
- Low cost.
